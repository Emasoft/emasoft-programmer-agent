# EPA Project Setup Skill

This skill provides procedures for setting up project configuration and tooling when starting work on a new project. It covers language detection, package manager initialization, dependency installation, linting configuration, testing framework setup, and SERENA MCP activation.

## Overview

The EPA Project Setup skill equips the Emasoft Programmer Agent (EPA) with a complete, repeatable procedure for initializing any new project workspace. When an EPA agent receives its first task on a project, it must configure the development environment before writing any code. This skill guides that process across eight supported languages (Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Rust, Go, .NET, C/C++, Objective-C, Swift) by providing six sequential operations: language detection, package manager initialization, dependency installation, linting configuration, testing framework setup, and SERENA MCP activation. Each operation has its own detailed reference file under the `references/` subdirectory. The skill ensures that every EPA agent starts from a consistent, fully-configured environment regardless of project language or existing state.

## Instructions

Follow these numbered steps in exact order to set up a new project:

1. **Read this entire SKILL.md** to understand the operations and their order before executing anything.
2. **Navigate to the project root directory** and confirm you have write access to the project folder.
3. **Detect the project language** by reading [op-detect-project-language.md](references/op-detect-project-language.md) and executing its procedure. Record the detected language for subsequent steps.
4. **Initialize the package manager** by reading [op-initialize-package-manager.md](references/op-initialize-package-manager.md) for the detected language and executing its procedure. Verify initialization succeeded by running the package manager's version command.
5. **Install all dependencies** by reading [op-install-dependencies.md](references/op-install-dependencies.md) and executing its procedure. Confirm zero errors in the installation output.
6. **Configure linting tools** by reading [op-configure-linting.md](references/op-configure-linting.md) and executing its procedure. For Python projects, also read [ruff-configuration-patterns.md](references/ruff-configuration-patterns.md). Run the linter once to verify it executes without configuration errors.
7. **Set up the testing framework** by reading [op-setup-testing-framework.md](references/op-setup-testing-framework.md) and executing its procedure. Run the test suite once (even if no tests exist yet) to confirm the framework is properly configured.
8. **Activate SERENA MCP** by reading [op-activate-serena-mcp.md](references/op-activate-serena-mcp.md) and executing its procedure. Verify SERENA responds to a test command such as `find_symbol`.
9. **Complete the checklist** at the bottom of this file by marking all items as done.
10. **Report setup status** to the orchestrator agent (EOA) confirming the environment is ready for task execution.

## Output

After successful execution of this skill, the following artifacts and states are produced:

- **Initialized package manager** — A working package manager configuration file exists (for example `pyproject.toml` for Python, `package.json` for JavaScript/TypeScript, `Cargo.toml` for Rust, `go.mod` for Go).
- **Installed dependency tree** — All project dependencies are installed and resolvable. Virtual environments are created where applicable (for example `.venv/` for Python projects).
- **Linter configuration files** — Language-appropriate linter configuration is in place and verified (for example `ruff.toml` for Python, `.eslintrc` for JavaScript/TypeScript, `clippy.toml` for Rust).
- **Testing framework configuration** — Test runner is configured and can be invoked (for example `pytest.ini` or `pyproject.toml [tool.pytest]` for Python, `jest.config.js` for JavaScript).
- **Active SERENA MCP connection** — SERENA is activated and responding to code navigation commands.
- **Completed setup checklist** — All six checklist items marked as done, confirming environment readiness.

## Checklist

Use this checklist to track setup progress:

- [ ] Project language detected and confirmed
- [ ] Package manager initialized and verified
- [ ] All dependencies installed successfully
- [ ] Linting tools configured and tested
- [ ] Testing framework configured and verified
- [ ] SERENA MCP activated and responding

## Troubleshooting

### Package Manager Not Found

**Problem**: The expected package manager is not installed on the system.

**Solution**: Install the package manager first. See the specific operation file for installation instructions for each package manager.

### Dependency Installation Fails

**Problem**: Dependencies fail to install due to version conflicts or missing packages.

**Solution**: Check the op-install-dependencies.md file for troubleshooting steps specific to each package manager.

### Linter Configuration Errors

**Problem**: Linter fails to run or produces incorrect configuration errors.

**Solution**: Verify the linter configuration file format. See op-configure-linting.md for correct configuration templates.

### SERENA MCP Not Responding

**Problem**: SERENA MCP fails to activate or does not respond to commands.

**Solution**: See op-activate-serena-mcp.md for SERENA-specific troubleshooting steps.

### Multi-Language Project Setup

**Problem**: Project uses multiple languages and needs multiple toolchains.

**Solution**: Run the setup procedure for each language independently. Start with the primary language (usually the one with the entry point), then set up secondary languages.

## Error Handling

When errors occur during project setup, follow these resolution steps:

1. **Language detection returns "unknown"** — If no recognizable project files are found, check that you are in the correct project root directory. Look for hidden configuration files (for example `.python-version`, `.nvmrc`). If the project is truly empty, ask the orchestrator (EOA) for the intended language before proceeding.
2. **Package manager command exits with non-zero code** — Do not attempt fallback package managers. Read the exact error message, check whether the package manager binary is installed and on PATH, and verify the correct version is available. Report the exact error to EOA if the binary is missing.
3. **Dependency version conflict during installation** — Read the conflict message to identify which packages have incompatible version requirements. Do not downgrade or remove packages without orchestrator approval. Report the specific conflicting packages and versions to EOA.
4. **Linter produces configuration parse errors** — Verify the configuration file syntax matches the linter version installed. Common cause: using configuration keys from a newer version of the linter than what is installed. Check the installed linter version with its `--version` flag.
5. **Test framework import errors on first run** — This usually means the testing library was not included in the dependency installation step. Verify the test dependency is listed in the project manifest (for example `[tool.pytest]` in `pyproject.toml`) and re-run dependency installation.
6. **SERENA MCP activation timeout** — Verify the SERENA MCP server process is running. Check the MCP configuration in `.claude/settings.json`. If the server is not configured, follow the full activation procedure in [op-activate-serena-mcp.md](references/op-activate-serena-mcp.md).
7. **Permission denied errors on any step** — Do not use `sudo` or change file ownership. Report the permission issue and the exact file path to EOA for resolution.
