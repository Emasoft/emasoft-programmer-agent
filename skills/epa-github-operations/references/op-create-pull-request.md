## When to Use

- Task implementation is complete
- All tests pass locally
- Code is ready for review
- Submitting work for EIA review (Step 19)

## Prerequisites

- Feature branch pushed to remote
- All changes committed
- Tests passing
- gh CLI authenticated

## Procedure

### 4.1 Preparing Branch for PR

Before creating PR, ensure branch is ready:

```bash
# Ensure all changes are committed
git status
# Should show: nothing to commit, working tree clean

# Ensure branch is pushed
git push origin <branch-name>

# Sync with main to check for conflicts
git fetch origin main
git merge origin/main
# Resolve any conflicts if needed

# Run tests one final time
# (command depends on project)
```

### 4.2 Writing PR Title and Description

**Title format** (same as commit message):
```
<type>(<scope>): <short description>
```

Keep under 72 characters. Use imperative mood.

**Description template:**

```markdown
## Summary
Brief description of what this PR does.

## Changes
- Change 1
- Change 2
- Change 3

## Testing
How was this tested?

## Related Issues
Closes #123
```

### 4.3 Creating PR with gh CLI

Create PR using heredoc for proper formatting:

```bash
gh pr create --title "<type>(<scope>): <description>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<1-3 sentences describing the change>

## Changes
- <specific change 1>
- <specific change 2>
- <specific change 3>

## Testing
- [ ] Unit tests pass
- [ ] Integration tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing completed

## Related Issues
Closes #<issue-number>
EOF
)"
```

**Full example:**

```bash
gh pr create --title "feat(auth): add OAuth2 login support" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
Implements OAuth2 authentication flow with support for Google and GitHub providers.

## Changes
- Add OAuth2Strategy class for handling OAuth flows
- Configure passport.js middleware for each provider

- [ ] Integration tests with mock OAuth server pass
- [ ] Manual testing with real Google account

## Related Issues

EOF
)"
```

### 4.4 Setting Reviewers and Labels

Add reviewers and labels at creation time:

```bash
gh pr create \
  --title "feat(auth): add OAuth2 login" \
  --body "..." \
  --reviewer "username1,username2" \
  --label "enhancement,ai-review"
```

Or add after creation:

```bash
# Add reviewer
gh pr edit <pr-number> --add-reviewer "username"

# Add label
gh pr edit <pr-number> --add-label "enhancement"

# Add assignee
gh pr edit <pr-number> --add-assignee "@me"
```

### 4.5 Linking to Issues

Link PR to issues to auto-close them on merge:

In PR description, use keywords:
- `Closes #123` - Closes issue when PR merges
- `Fixes #123` - Same as Closes
- `Resolves #123` - Same as Closes
- `Related to #123` - Links without closing

Multiple issues:
```markdown
Closes #123, Closes #124
Fixes #125
Related to #126
```

### Example 3: Draft PR for Early Feedback

  --body "WIP: Initial Stripe integration. Looking for early feedback on approach." \
  --draft
```

Convert draft to ready for review:
```bash
gh pr ready <pr-number>
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `no commits between main and branch` | Branch not diverged | Make commits on feature branch |
| `pull request already exists` | PR exists for this branch | Use existing PR or close it first |
| `branch not found on remote` | Not pushed | `git push -u origin <branch>` |
| `validation failed` | Missing required fields | Check repo PR template requirements |
| `user not found` | Wrong reviewer username | Verify username spelling |

## Recovery Steps

If PR was created with wrong title:
```bash
gh pr edit <pr-number> --title "correct title"
```

If PR was created with wrong description:
```bash
gh pr edit <pr-number> --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
new description
EOF
)"
```

If PR was created against wrong base branch:
```bash
gh pr edit <pr-number> --base correct-branch
```

If you need to completely redo:
```bash
# Close the PR
gh pr close <pr-number>

# Create new PR
gh pr create ...
```
