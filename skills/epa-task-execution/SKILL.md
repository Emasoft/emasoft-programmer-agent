# EPA Task Execution Skill

Execute programming tasks according to requirements and acceptance criteria received from the orchestrator.

## Overview

The EPA Task Execution skill is the core operational skill for the Emasoft Programmer Agent (EPA). It defines the end-to-end workflow a programmer agent follows when assigned a coding task by an orchestrator agent (EOA). The workflow covers every phase from receiving the task assignment via AI Maestro messaging, through parsing requirements, setting up the development environment, implementing code, writing tests, and validating acceptance criteria. This skill ensures that every task is completed methodically, with full traceability from requirement to implementation to verification. It depends on SERENA MCP for code navigation and AI Maestro for inter-agent communication.

## Instructions

Follow these numbered steps in order for every assigned task:

1. **Receive the task assignment** -- Read the incoming AI Maestro message from the orchestrator agent, extract the task identifier and metadata, validate all required fields are present, and send an acknowledgment back to the orchestrator.
2. **Parse the task requirements** -- Extract the full list of acceptance criteria, identify any dependencies on other tasks that must be completed first, determine which files and components will be modified, and ask the orchestrator for clarification on anything ambiguous.
3. **Set up the development environment** -- Navigate to the target project directory, activate the correct virtual environment (using `uv venv` or `source .venv/bin/activate`), verify all dependencies are installed, and initialize SERENA MCP for code navigation.
4. **Implement the code** -- Use SERENA MCP to analyze the existing code structure, plan the implementation approach in small increments, write code in testable chunks, and add documentation and comments explaining the "why" of each change.
5. **Write tests** -- Identify test scenarios directly from the requirements, write unit tests for all new functions, write integration tests where applicable, run all tests, and fix any failures before proceeding.
6. **Validate acceptance criteria** -- Review each acceptance criterion one by one, verify the implementation satisfies it, document the evidence of validation, and report task completion to the orchestrator via AI Maestro.
7. **Report completion** -- Send a structured completion message to the orchestrator that includes the task identifier, list of files modified, test results summary, and confirmation that all acceptance criteria passed.

## Output

This skill produces the following artifacts upon successful task completion:

- **Implemented code changes** -- New or modified source files in the target project, with inline comments explaining the purpose of each change.
- **Test suite** -- Unit tests and integration tests covering all new functionality, located in the project's `tests/` directory.
- **Validation report** -- A structured message sent to the orchestrator via AI Maestro confirming each acceptance criterion was met, including evidence (test results, code references).
- **Updated checklist** -- The master checklist (defined below) with all items checked, serving as the task completion record.
- **Git commit** -- A commit containing all code and test changes, with a descriptive commit message referencing the task identifier.

## Examples

### Example 1: Implementing a New Utility Function

The orchestrator assigns task `TASK-042: Add a string sanitization function to utils.py`. The programmer agent:
1. Receives the AI Maestro message, extracts task ID `TASK-042` and reads the acceptance criteria: "Function `sanitize_input(text: str) -> str` must strip HTML tags, normalize whitespace, and return a clean string."
2. Uses SERENA MCP to find `utils.py` and understand existing utility patterns.
3. Implements `sanitize_input()` following the existing code style in `utils.py`.
4. Writes 4 unit tests in `tests/test_utils.py`: empty string, normal text, HTML-laden text, and whitespace-heavy text.
5. Runs `uv run pytest tests/test_utils.py -v`, confirms all 4 pass.
6. Sends completion message to orchestrator: "TASK-042 complete. Modified: src/utils.py, tests/test_utils.py. All 4 tests passing. Acceptance criteria met."

### Example 2: Fixing a Bug in an Existing Module

The orchestrator assigns task `BUG-017: Fix off-by-one error in pagination logic`. The programmer agent:
1. Reads the task requirements: "The `paginate()` function in `src/api/pagination.py` returns one fewer item than expected on the last page."
2. Uses SERENA MCP to locate `paginate()`, reads the function body, and traces the logic to find the off-by-one error at the boundary calculation.
3. Fixes the boundary calculation, adds a comment explaining why `<=` is correct instead of `<`.
4. Adds a regression test specifically for the last-page edge case.
5. Runs the full test suite to confirm no regressions.
6. Reports completion with the fix description and test evidence.

### Example 3: Handling a Blocked Task

The orchestrator assigns task `TASK-055: Add caching layer to data fetcher`. The programmer agent:
1. Parses requirements and discovers dependency on `TASK-054: Implement Redis client wrapper`, which is not yet complete.
2. Does NOT proceed with implementation. Instead, sends a blocker report to the orchestrator: "TASK-055 blocked by TASK-054 (Redis client wrapper not yet available). Awaiting guidance."
3. Waits for orchestrator response before taking any action.

## Purpose

This skill provides the complete workflow for receiving, understanding, implementing, testing, and validating programming tasks. It ensures all acceptance criteria are met before marking a task as complete.

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- You receive a task assignment via AI Maestro message
- You need to implement code changes according to specifications
- You must validate your implementation against acceptance criteria

## Prerequisites

Before using this skill:
1. SERENA MCP must be activated for code navigation
2. Development environment must be configured for the target project
3. You must have received a valid task assignment with requirements

## Task Execution Workflow
