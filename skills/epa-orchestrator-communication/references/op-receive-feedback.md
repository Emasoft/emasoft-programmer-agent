## 6.1 Monitoring for Feedback

After sending a completion notification, actively monitor for EOA feedback.

### Checking for Messages

Check your inbox using the `agent-messaging` skill. Look for unread messages from the orchestrator.

To read a specific message, use the `agent-messaging` skill's read operation with the message ID to see its full content.

### Polling Interval

| After Event | Poll Interval | Duration |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| Completion notification | Every 5 minutes | 2 hours |
| Urgent blocker report | Every 2 minutes | 30 minutes |
| Status update | Every 15 minutes | 4 hours |

### Message Priority Handling

When multiple messages arrive:

1. **Read all messages first**: Do not act on partial information
2. **Process by priority**: URGENT > HIGH > NORMAL
3. **Oldest first within priority**: FIFO within same priority level

## Prerequisites

Before processing feedback:

1. **Read complete message**: Do not skim or skip content
2. **Understand the context**: Know which task the feedback relates to
3. **Assess scope**: Determine the extent of required changes
4. **Plan response**: Decide on action before responding

## 6.3 Processing Feedback

### Step-by-Step Processing

1. **Read the full message**: Understand complete context
2. **Identify feedback type**: Determine which type of feedback
3. **Extract action items**: List all required actions
4. **Prioritize actions**: Order by severity and dependency
5. **Plan implementation**: Estimate effort for each action
6. **Send acknowledgment**: Confirm receipt and understanding
7. **Execute actions**: Implement required changes
8. **Report completion**: Notify when revisions complete

### Processing Revision Requests

For each change request:

| Step | Action |

| 2 | Locate the relevant code |
| 3 | Understand why the change is needed |
| 4 | Implement the suggested fix (or better alternative) |
| 5 | Test the change |
| 6 | Commit with descriptive message |

### Handling Multiple Changes

When multiple changes are requested:

1. **Categorize by severity**: Critical > Major > Minor
2. **Identify dependencies**: Some changes may depend on others
3. **Address critical first**: Fix blockers before enhancements
4. **Batch commits logically**: Group related changes
5. **Test after each batch**: Verify no regressions

## Procedure

Follow these steps when receiving feedback:

1. **Check inbox**: Monitor for new messages
2. **Read feedback completely**: Do not skim
3. **Identify feedback type**: Determine category

5. **Send acknowledgment**: Confirm receipt immediately
6. **Plan response**: Estimate effort and timeline
7. **Implement changes**: Address all action items
8. **Test changes**: Verify all changes work
9. **Commit and push**: Update the branch
10. **Send update**: Notify EOA of completed revisions
