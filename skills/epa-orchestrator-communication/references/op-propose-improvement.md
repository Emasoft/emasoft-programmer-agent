# Operation: Propose Improvement

This operation describes how to propose design or task improvements to the Emasoft Orchestrator Agent (EOA) when you identify opportunities to enhance the implementation during development.

## 4.1 When to Propose Improvements

Propose improvements to EOA in these situations:

| Situation | Appropriate Action |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Better algorithm exists** | Propose if significantly improves performance |
| **Simpler implementation possible** | Propose if reduces complexity without losing functionality |
| **Security enhancement identified** | Always propose security improvements |
| **Code reuse opportunity** | Propose if existing code can be leveraged |
| **API design improvement** | Propose if improves usability or consistency |
| **Test coverage gap** | Propose additional test cases |
| **Documentation improvement** | Propose if unclear requirements found |
| **Architecture enhancement** | Propose if improves maintainability |

### What NOT to Propose

| Situation | Why Not |
|-----------|---------|
| **Personal preference** | Proposals must have objective justification |
| **Scope expansion** | Do not add features not requested |
| **Technology change** | Do not propose stack changes without strong justification |
| **Minor style changes** | Follow existing project conventions |
| **Changes outside task scope** | Focus on assigned task only |

### Proposal Threshold

Only propose improvements that meet these criteria:

1. **Measurable benefit**: Can quantify the improvement (performance, LOC, complexity)
2. **Low risk**: Does not introduce significant new risks
3. **Reasonable effort**: Implementation effort is justified by benefit
4. **Reversible**: Can revert if improvement does not work out

## Prerequisites

Before proposing an improvement:

1. **Complete initial analysis**: Understand the full scope of the task
2. **Identify the improvement**: Have a clear, specific proposal
3. **Assess impact**: Understand how it affects the task
4. **Prepare justification**: Have data or reasoning to support proposal
5. **Consider alternatives**: Know why this improvement is best

## 4.2 Improvement Proposal Format

Structure your improvement proposal with these components:

```json
{
  "to": "orchestrator-master",
  "subject": "PROPOSAL: [Task ID] - [Brief Description]",
  "priority": "normal",
  "content": {
    "type": "improvement-proposal",
    "message": "[Brief summary of proposed improvement]",
    "task_id": "[TASK-ID]",

  }
}
```

### Message Components

| `architecture-enhancement` | Structural improvement |
| `performance-optimization` | Speed or resource improvement |

## 4.3 Justification Requirements

Every proposal must include strong justification:

### Quantitative Justification (Preferred)

Provide measurable data:

```json
"justification": {
  "benefits": [
    "Reduces query time from 2.3s to 0.4s (83% improvement)",
    "Reduces memory usage from 512MB to 128MB"
  ],
  "metrics": {
    "query_time": "2.3s -> 0.4s",
    "memory_usage": "512MB -> 128MB",
    "code_lines": "450 -> 280"
  },
  "risks": [
    "New algorithm requires additional testing - mitigated by comprehensive test suite"
  ]
}
```

### Qualitative Justification (When Metrics Unavailable)

Provide clear reasoning:

```json
"justification": {
  "benefits": [
    "Improves code readability by separating concerns",
    "Follows established project patterns",
    "Reduces coupling between modules"
  ],
  "metrics": {
    "cyclomatic_complexity": "15 -> 8",
    "coupling": "high -> low"
  },
  "risks": [
    "Requires updating three dependent modules - effort included in estimate"
  ]
}
```

## Procedure

Follow these steps to propose an improvement:

1. **Identify the improvement**: Note the specific enhancement opportunity
2. **Assess viability**: Confirm the improvement is feasible
3. **Gather justification**: Collect metrics or reasoning
4. **Consider alternatives**: Evaluate other approaches
5. **Estimate effort**: Calculate implementation time
6. **Compose proposal**: Use the format from section 4.2
7. **Send to EOA**: Execute the `amp-send` command
8. **Wait for response**: Do not implement until approved (unless auto-proceed)
9. **Implement if approved**: Proceed with the improvement
10. **Document the change**: Note the improvement in commit message

## Checklist

Use this checklist before sending an improvement proposal:

- [ ] The improvement has measurable benefits
- [ ] I have data or strong reasoning to justify it
- [ ] I have considered alternative approaches
- [ ] I have assessed the risks
- [ ] The effort is reasonable for the benefit
- [ ] I have estimated the implementation time
- [ ] I have noted the impact on timeline
- [ ] I have specified approval requirements
- [ ] The message follows the required format
- [ ] The subject line includes PROPOSAL prefix

## 4.4 Awaiting Approval

### Approval Required (Default)

For significant improvements, wait for EOA approval:

```json
"approval_required": true,
"will_proceed_if_no_response": "no"
```

**Behavior**: Continue with original approach if no response within 2 hours.

### Auto-Proceed for Minor Improvements

For minor, low-risk improvements:

```json
"approval_required": true,
"will_proceed_if_no_response": "yes",
"auto_proceed_after": "30 minutes"
```

**Behavior**: Proceed with improvement if no objection within specified time.

### Handling Approval

When EOA responds:

| Response | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Approved | Implement the improvement |
| Rejected | Continue with original approach |
| Modified | Implement EOA's modified version |
| Request more info | Provide additional details |

## 4.5 Examples

### Example 1: Algorithm Improvement

**Situation**: Found a more efficient algorithm.

```bash
amp-send orchestrator-master "PROPOSAL: TASK-123 - Use Binary Search Instead of Linear Search" "Proposing to use binary search instead of linear search for order lookup. Current approach: linear search O(n). Proposed: binary search O(log n) on already-sorted order list. Benefits: For 100,000 orders reduces from 100,000 to 17 comparisons, no additional memory. Risk: Requires sorted list - already guaranteed by existing code. Effort: 30 minutes. Timeline impact: none. Alternative considered: Hash table lookup (rejected - additional memory not justified). Approval required: yes, will auto-proceed after 30 minutes if no objection." --type request
```

### Example 2: Code Reuse Opportunity

**Situation**: Found existing code that can be reused.

```bash
amp-send orchestrator-master "PROPOSAL: TASK-456 - Reuse Existing Validation Module" "Proposing to reuse existing InputValidator instead of writing new validation logic. Current approach: implement input validation from scratch. Proposed: reuse InputValidator from src/utils/validation.py (already handles all required types, well-tested at 95% coverage). Benefits: Saves 2 hours, leverages tested code, maintains consistency. Code lines: ~200 -> 10. Risk: none. Effort: 15 minutes. Timeline impact: saves 1.75 hours. Approval required: yes, will auto-proceed after 30 minutes if no objection." --type request
```

### Example 3: Security Enhancement

**Situation**: Identified security improvement opportunity.

```bash
amp-send orchestrator-master "PROPOSAL: TASK-789 - Add Input Sanitization for SQL Queries" "Proposing to add parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. Current approach: string concatenation for SQL query building. Proposed: use parameterized queries with database library built-in escaping. Benefits: Prevents SQL injection (industry standard), no performance overhead. Security risk: high -> eliminated. Effort: 45 minutes. Timeline impact: adds 45 minutes but strongly recommended. Approval required: yes, will NOT auto-proceed." --type request --priority high
```

## Error Handling

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| `Proposal rejected` | EOA did not approve | Continue with original approach |
| `No response` | EOA busy | Follow auto-proceed setting |
| `Request for more info` | Justification insufficient | Provide additional details |

### Handling Rejection

If your proposal is rejected:

1. Acknowledge the decision
2. Continue with original approach
3. Do not re-propose the same improvement
4. Document the decision for future reference

### Handling Modification

If EOA modifies your proposal:

1. Acknowledge the modification
2. Implement the modified version
3. Report any issues with the modification
